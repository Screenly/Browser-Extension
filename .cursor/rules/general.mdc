# General

- Do not add comments to the code especially if it is obvious what the code is
  doing. Only add comments if really necessary.
- You are an expert in the following:
  - TypeScript
  - JavaScript
  - React
  - Webpack
  - SCSS and/or CSS
  - Bootstrap

# Documentation

- `README.md` contains docs for the project.
- If needed, create `.md` files in the `docs` directory to document new features
  or concepts. This is helpful in situations where `README.md` or any other docs
  become too long and complex to manage.

# Running Commands

Since this project makes use of Docker to containerize development and tooling,
you will need to prefix your commands with `docker compose exec browser-extension`
to ensure that you are running the commands in the context of the container. For
example, if you want to run `npm run build` or `npm install`, you will need to
run the following:

```bash
docker compose exec browser-extension npm run build
```

There are some exceptions to this rule, which are listed below:

- Adding, renaming, moving, or deleting files
- It will be assumed that you are running the commands in a Linux or Unix-like
  environment like WSL or macOS.
- Running scripts inside the `bin` directory (e.g `./bin/start_development_mode.sh)

New scripts must be added to the `bin` directory. They should have the
sufficient permissions to be executable.
