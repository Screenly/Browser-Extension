# TypeScript

- Most of the codebase is written in TypeScript.
- React components must be written in the `src/assets/ts/components` directory.
- When declaring new types and interfaces, make sure to add them to the
  `src/assets/ts/types` directory.
- New files and directories must follow the kebab-case naming convention.
- Don't use `any` as a type. The changes will cause compiler and linter errors.
